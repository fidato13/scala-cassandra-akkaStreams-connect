Install cassandra using brew. See below link for more details:
https://gist.github.com/virajkulkarni14/1f79175ddbb2a0595118be8a9431f4bd

to start cassandra :
launchctl start homebrew.mxcl.cassandra

to stop cassandra:
launchctl stop homebrew.mxcl.cassandra

once you have cassandra cluster up and running, you can connect with it using a cql client:
cqlsh localhost â€”cqlversion="3.4.2"

in the above command specifying version of cql is necessary as otherwise it gives compatibility issues with lower versions.

Refer to Sdriver.scala for basic crud operations.

For Bulkloading, it is necessary to create table with appropriate schema for the column family in advance before attempting to bulkload.

Refer to Bulkload.scala for the bulkloading details.
Note: BulkLoading to cassancdra involves two steps:
1. Creation of ssTable files. refer to BulkLoad.scala ... This code creates the data(sstable) files at a 
location specified by user
2. Once the data files are ready , now we need to register them with cassandra cluster so that they can be 
loaded as cassandra tables. For this cassandra's sstableloader utility is used:

/usr/local/Cellar/cassandra/3.7/bin/sstableloader -d 127.0.0.1 /trn/eclipse_workspace/scala-cassandra-connect/ruf/simplex/historical_prices

Note: the above data files directory should have the absolute path else it will throw a null pointer exception. this is a bug in cassandra 3.1 onwards i think.
